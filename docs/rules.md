# Triple Triad Region & Trade Rules

## Regional Rules

  - Open
    > Enables the player to see which cards the opponent is using.
    (Balamb)

  - Same
    > When a card is placed touching two or more other cards (one or both of
    them have to be the opposite color), and the touching sides of each card is
    the same (8 touching 8 for example), then the other two cards are flipped.
    Combo rule applies.
    (Galbadia, Centra, Lunar)

  - Same Wall
    > An extension of the Same rule. The edges of the board are counted as A
    ranks for the purposes of the Same rule. Combo rule applies. If the Same
    rule is not present in a region that has Same Wall, Same Wall will not
    appear in the list of rules when starting a game because it can have no
    effect without Same. However, it will still be carried with the player to
    other regions, and can therefore still be spread.
    (Esthar, Lunar)

  - Sudden Death
    > If the game ends in a draw, a sudden death occurs in which a new game is
    started but the cards are distributed on the side of the color they were on
    at the end of the game.
    (FH, Lunar)

  - Random
    > Five cards are randomly chosen from the player's deck instead of the
    player being able to choose five cards themselves.
    (Dollet, Trabia, Centra, Lunar)

  - Plus
    > Similar to the Same rule. When one card is placed touching two others
    and the ranks touching the cards plus the opposing rank equal the same sum,
    then both cards are captured. Combo rule applies.
    (Trabia, Centra, Lunar)

  - Elemental
    > In the elemental rule, one or more of the spaces are randomly marked
    with an element. Some cards have elements in the upper-right corner of the
    card. Ruby Dragon, for example, is fire-elemental, and Quezacotl is
    thunder-elemental. When an elemental card is placed on a corresponding
    element, each rank goes up one point. When any card is placed on a
    non-matching element, each rank goes down one point. This does not affect
    the Same, Plus and Same Wall rules, where the cards' original ranks apply.
    (Dollet, FH, Esthar, Lunar)

### Additional Notes

  - Combo
    > Of the cards captured by the Same, Same Wall or Plus rule, if they are
    adjacent to another card whose rank is lower, then it is captured as well.
    This is not a separate rule; any time Same or Plus is in effect, Combo is
    in effect as well.

## Trade Rules

  - One
    > The most common rule in which the winner takes any one of the opponent's
    cards.

  - Diff (Difference)
    > The winner takes as many cards as there is a difference between pink
    cards and blue cards.

  - Direct
    > Players take cards that are their color at the end of the game.

  - All
    > Winner takes all.
