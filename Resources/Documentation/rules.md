# Triple Triad Card Rules

## Same

  When a card is placed touching two or more other cards (one or both of them have to be the opposite color), and the touching sides of each card is the same (8 touching 8 for example), then the other two cards are flipped. Combo rule applies.

## Same Wall

  An extension of the Same rule. The edges of the board are counted as A ranks for the purposes of the Same rule. If the Same rule is not present in a region that has Same Wall, Same Wall will not appear in the list of rules when starting a game because it can have no effect without Same. However, it will still be carried with the player to other regions, and can therefore still be spread. Combo rule applies.

## Plus

  Similar to the Same rule. When one card is placed touching two others and the ranks touching the cards plus the opposing rank equal the same sum, then both cards are captured. Combo rule applies.

## Elemental

  In the elemental rule, one or more of the spaces are randomly marked with an element. Some cards have elements in the upper-right corner of the card. Ruby Dragon, for example, is fire-elemental, and Quezacotl is thunder-elemental. When an elemental card is placed on a corresponding element, each rank goes up one point. When any card is placed on a non-matching element, each rank goes down one point. This does not affect the Same, Plus and Same Wall rules, where the cards' original ranks apply.

## Open

  Enables the player to see which cards the opponent is using.

## Random

  Five cards are randomly chosen from the player's deck instead of the player being able to choose five cards themselves.

## Sudden Death

  If the game ends in a draw, a sudden death occurs in which a new game is started but the cards are distributed on the side of the color they were on at the end of the game.

### Combo Rules

  Of the cards captured by the Same, Same Wall or Plus rule, if they are adjacent to another card whose rank is lower, then it is captured as well. This is not a separate rule; any time Same or Plus is in effect, Combo is in effect as well.

### Scoreboard

* Each player starts out with five (5) points -- this is determined from the number of cards in their hand.

* Each card acquired on the game board adds one (1) point to your score.

* At the end of game, the player with the highest point score wins the round.

* Score is calculated at the end of each player turn as such:
> score = ( cards in hand ) + ( cards on board in possession )

### Trade Rules

- One
> The most common rule in which the winner takes any one of the opponent's cards.

- Diff (Difference)
> The winner takes as many cards as there is a difference between pink cards and blue cards.

- Direct
> Players take cards that are their color at the end of the game.

- All
> Winner takes all.
